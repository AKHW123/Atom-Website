  <h1>Top 5 Worst Ratings in NHL 21</h1>

  <h2>Let's Take a Look at Some of EA Sports' Worst Player Ratings This Year</h2>

  <p class="paragraphHeader">5. Connor McDavid - 95 Overall</p>
  <p class="paragraph">His rating is already 95 overall, but he really should be higher. Seriously, he is the best player in hockey. It is impossible to find a highlight reel from the 2019-2020 season without at least 5 goals from Connor McDavid.
    Despite only playing 64/82 games this season, he still managed to be second in the league in points this season with a total of 97 points (fitting, really). His skill is just on a different level, and he should be at least a 96 or 97 overall.
    Plus, he did this:

  <p class="paragraphHeader">4. Drew Doughty - 91 Overall</p>

  <p class="paragraph">Coming from a Kings fan, there is no way Drew Doughty should be tied for the best defenseman in the league based on overall rating. His best days are behind him, and even though you could say that he just plays for a bad team,
    he is still way overrated by EA. Despite playing on the top defensive pair all season long, he finished at a +/- of -16 and served 36 penalty minutes, which was the fourth highest on the whole team. However, maybe a deserves a 99 Overall for his
    chirp game.
  <p class="paragraphHeader">3. Phil Kessel - 93 Rated Slapshot Power</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Have you ever seen Phil Kessel take a slapshot? Since the 2009/2010 season, out of his 2795 shots, only 113 (4.0%) of his shots have even been slapshots. And, of those 113 slapshots, he has only scored on 3 of them, even though
    he scores on more than 1/10 of his other shots. I honestly have no idea where EA got this one, or if Phil Kessel has ever even had his slapshot power measured. Here is the only slapshot goals I could find from Phil Kessel, which isn't even really
    a slapshot:</p>

  <p class="paragraphHeader">2. Braden Holtby - 88 Overall</p>
  <center><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/akseliwebsite.appspot.com/o/Holtby.png?alt=media&token=07203c0c-f0d9-4df8-93ac-0ebc65cee593"></img></center>
  <p class="paragraph">This one is just a no-brainer. Holtby had a terrible season that ended with him getting traded, and he has no reason to be in the top 10 goalies this year. He finished the season with a save percentage of less than .900, and he
    gave up an average of 3.11 goals per game. 3.11. That puts him in the bottom half of all goalies this year. And he played for a good team that just won the cup.
  <p class="paragraphHeader">1. Cale Makar - 85 Overall</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Despite winning the Calder Trophy, he isn't even the best rated rookie this year, which makes absolutely no sense. He finished the regular season with 12 goals and 50 points and a +/- of +12, despite only playing 57 games AS A
    ROOKIE DEFENSEMAN. On top of that, he only had 12 penalty minutes all season, and he put up an average of one point per game during the playoffs. AS A ROOKIE DEFENSEMAN. This one is completely ridiculous, and it has earned the #1 spot.
